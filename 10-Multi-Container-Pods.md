# Multi Container Pods

- Additional Containers to modify or present data generated by main container:
  - Sidecar: provides additional functionality to main container
  - Ambassador: proxy to connect containers externally
  - Adapter: standardize or normalize main container output
  - Since v1.29, initContainer that has `restartPolicy: always` is also referred to as Sidecar
- Pod Volumes as shared storage: e.g. main container write to it, helper pod pick up data
